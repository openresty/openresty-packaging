Description: unknown
 This module provides some extra datatypes that are used by common
 serialisation formats such as JSON or CBOR. The idea is to have a
 repository of simple/small constants and containers that can be shared by
 different implementations so they become interoperable between each other.
 .
 This build is specifically for OpenResty uses.

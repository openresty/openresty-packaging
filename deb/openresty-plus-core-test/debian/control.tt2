Description: resty command-line utility for OpenResty+
 This package contains the "resty" command-line utility for OpenResty+, which
 runs OpenResty Lua scripts on the terminal using a headless NGINX behind the
 scene.
 .
 OpenResty is a full-fledged web platform by integrating the standard Nginx
 core, LuaJIT, many carefully written Lua libraries, lots of high quality
 3rd-party Nginx modules, and most of their external dependencies. It is
 designed to help developers easily build scalable web applications, web
 services, and dynamic web gateways.

 core, LuaJIT, many carefully written Lua libraries, lots of high quality
 3rd-party Nginx modules, and most of their external dependencies. It is
 designed to help developers easily build scalable web applications, web
 services, and dynamic web gateways.
 .
 By taking advantage of various well-designed Nginx modules (most of which
 are developed by the OpenResty team themselves), OpenResty effectively
 turns the nginx server into a powerful web app server, in which the web
 developers can use the Lua programming language to script various existing
 nginx C modules and Lua modules and construct extremely high-performance
 web applications that are capable to handle 10K ~ 1000K+ connections in
 a single box.

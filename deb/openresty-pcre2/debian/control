Description: Perl-compatible regular expression library
 PCRE2 is a re-working of the original PCRE (Perl-compatible regular
 expression) library to provide an entirely new API.
 PCRE2 is written in C, and it has its own API. There are three sets of
 functions, one for the 8-bit library, which processes strings of bytes, one
 for the 16-bit library, which processes strings of 16-bit values, and one for
 the 32-bit library, which processes strings of 32-bit values. There are no C++
 wrappers. This package provides support for strings in 8-bit and UTF-8
 encodings.
 The distribution does contain a set of C wrapper functions for the 8-bit
 library that are based on the POSIX regular expression API (see the pcre2posix
 man page). These can be found in a library called libpcre2posix. Note that
 this just provides a POSIX calling interface to PCRE2; the regular expressions
 themselves still follow Perl syntax and semantics. The POSIX API is
 restricted, and does not give full access to all of PCRE2's facilities.
